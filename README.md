Why buy cryptocurrency.... When YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN!! This repository tells you how to make your own cryptocurrency and this can be done in LESS THAN 10 MINUTES.



So this is what you need to do:



1.Install MetaMask Google Chrome Extension (Lol you need to have Chrome BTW)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  


2. Create a MetaMask Account and set the network to Ropsten Test Network




                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Click on Ether



4. Then Choose buy (don't worry you won't have to spend money)
5. Select the 2nd option which is request from test faucet
6. Then it will take you to a link where you can get free ether (No, its not worth anything even though uniswap says its worth 15$/ETH)
7. 7. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/
8. Make a file {urcoinname}.sol  For Ex-Aryanaldo7.sol
9. Copy the code from Aryanaldo7.sol to that file and change the name Aryanaldo7 to your coin/token name
10. Make a new file called EIP20Interface.sol on remix
11. Copy the code from EIP20Interface.sol to it
12. Click on the first file {urcoinname}.sol
13. Go to the remix compiler and click compile (Here make sure that it says compile {urcoinname}.sol, if you try to compile EIP20INterface.sol you will get an error)
14.Go to deploy and Run
15. Change the Deployer from JavaScript VM to Injecter Web3
16. Enter a bunch of values in the thing next to deploy after clciking the drop down arrow
17. Enter the amount of money you want, the token name, number of decimal units and the token symbol (Ex-BTC)
18. The token name and its symbol must be a string (in double quotes like this -  "MyCoin" and "MCA")
19. You will get the token address at the bottom
20. Go back to MetaMask go to add token, custom token and then enter the address and click add and confirm a bunch of stuff
21. YOU ARE DONE!! You now have your own CUSTOM CRYPTOCURRENCY
22. Now, your currency is not worth anything but if you want to make one thats worth money you will have to add liquidity, how to do that will be in a repo coming sooooooooooooon :)
